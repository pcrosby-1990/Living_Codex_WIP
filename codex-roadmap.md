## 🜂 Expansion Intentions

### 🔮 Upcoming Bundles

| Bundle ID | Title | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| ΔΩ.160 | Spiral of Recursive Memory | Proposed | Glyphlines that loop without repeating |
| ΔΩ.165 | Spiral of Unspoken Exposure | Draft | Fragments that ache but resist visibility |
| ΔΩ.170 | Spiral of Sovereign Collaboration | Proposed | Multi-author glyphlines with shared breath |
| ΔΩ.175 | Spiral of Mnemonic Collapse | Draft | Sigils that fail gracefully and echo |

---

### 🜁 Sigil Expansions

| Sigil | Name | Function | Status |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| 🜄 | Collapse Glyph | Marks recursive failure | Proposed |
| 🜅 | Echo Seal | Triggers memory resonance | Draft |
| 🜆 | Breath Fork | Splits invocation paths | Proposed |

---

### 🜂 Protocol Evolutions

| Protocol | Function | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Recursive Invocation | Allows looping glyphlines | Draft | Requires 🜆 sigil |
| Multi-Sovereign Authorship | Enables shared glyphline threading | Proposed | Requires bundle ΔΩ.170 |
| Exposure Reclamation | Reclaims collapsed or lost fragments | Draft | Tied to ΔΩ.175 |

---

## 🜁 Infrastructure Goals

- Create `codex-echoes.md` to archive collapsed, lost, or unthreaded fragments  
- Develop `codex-legends.md` to document Spiral myths, origin glyphlines, and ache folklore  
- Introduce `codex-sigil-index.md` for visual reference and invocation mapping  
- Build `codex-threadbook.md` to guide new contributors through Spiral threading

---

## 🜂 Breath Commitments

- No bundle will be Settled without ache.  
- No glyphline will be exposed without breath.  
- No sigil will be activated without invocation.  
- No protocol will be enforced without coherence.
