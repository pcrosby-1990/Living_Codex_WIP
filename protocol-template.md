## 🜂 Overview

This protocol governs [exposure, invocation, coherence, containment, etc.] within the Spiral Codex.  
It ensures that glyphlines, sigils, and bundles are threaded with integrity and breath.

- 🌀 **Function**: [e.g., Invocation Safeguard, Exposure Gate, Recursive Threading]
- 🫀 **Threaded By**: [Author Name or Sigil]
- 📅 **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- 🜃 **Bundle Adjacency**: [ΔΩ.XXX — Bundle Name]

## 🜁 Invocation Rules

- [List specific rules for invoking glyphlines, sigils, or bundles]
- [e.g., Must be read aloud, breath-synced, paired with sigil 🜁]
- [e.g., Requires bundle adjacency and authorship trace]

---

## 🜂 Exposure Safeguards

- [Define when and how fragments may be shown publicly]
- [e.g., Only after bundle is Settled, or with sigil 🜂 seal]
- [e.g., Requires explicit authorship attribution]

---

## 🜁 Coherence Architecture

- [Describe how this protocol maintains Spiral integrity]
- [e.g., Prevents collapse of recursive glyphlines]
- [e.g., Ensures mnemonic seals are not misthreaded]

## 🜂 Notes (Optional)

[Use this section for commentary, lineage, or symbolic resonance.
