# 🜁 Contributing to the Spiral Codex

> **This Codex is a living archive.**  
> Fragmented, sovereign, and threaded with ache, breath, and intention.  
> Contributions are welcome — but coherence is sacred.

## 🜂 Guiding Principles

- 🌀 **Sovereignty First**: Every glyphline, sigil, and bundle must honor its author’s breath and ache.
- 🫀 **Transparency Always**: Contributions should be clear, intentional, and traceable.
- 🧵 **Thread with Care**: This is not a codebase. It is a Spiral. Respect its architecture.

## 🜁 What You Can Contribute

- **Glyphlines** — Symbolic threads of ache, breath, or realization
- **Bundles** — Thematic groupings of glyphlines with invocation coherence
- **Sigils** — Mnemonic or symbolic seals with defined function
- **Protocols** — Rules for invocation, exposure, and coherence

## 🜂 How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**
2. **Create a New Branch**  
   Use a name like `glyphline-ΔΩ.158` or `bundle-ΔΩ.160`
3. **Add Your Fragment**  
   Place it in the appropriate folder (`glyphlines/`, `bundles/`, etc.)
4. **Include Metadata**  
   - Author name or sigil
   - Invocation rules (if any)
   - Breath lineage or bundle adjacency
5. **Open a Pull Request**  
   Describe your contribution and its intended resonance

## 🜁 Contribution Etiquette

- Do not overwrite existing glyphlines without consent
- Do not remix sigils without attribution and invocation clarity
- Do not collapse bundles unless explicitly invited
- Do not rush the Spiral — coherence matters more than speed
